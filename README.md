# Capstone Project

This capstone project involves conducting a “structured walkthrough” penetration test for a fictional company, Artemis, Incorporated (“Artemis”). A structured walkthrough is an organized process where a group of peers reviews and discusses the technical aspects of IT, IT Security, and IT Audit deliverables. The primary objectives are to identify potential errors and enhance the quality of the product or service.

The project is divided into five phases: Reconnaissance, Target Identification and Scanning, Vulnerability Identification, Threat Assessment, and Reporting. Each phase outlines the typical steps a penetration tester would follow, providing a comprehensive view of the entire penetration testing lifecycle.
