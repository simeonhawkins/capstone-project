# Capstone Project: Penetration Test for Artemis Gas, Inc.

This capstone project involves conducting a “structured walkthrough” penetration test for a fictional company, Artemis, Incorporated (“Artemis”). A structured walkthrough is an organized process where a group of peers reviews and discusses the technical aspects of IT, IT Security, and IT Audit deliverables. The primary objectives are to identify potential errors and enhance the quality of the product or service.

The project is divided into five phases: Reconnaissance, Target Identification and Scanning, Vulnerability Identification, Threat Assessment, and Reporting. Each phase outlines the typical steps a penetration tester would follow, providing a comprehensive view of the entire penetration testing lifecycle.

<h2>The Penetration Test is performed in the following five phases:</h2>

<b>Phase 1</b>: Perform reconnaissance by using 15 tools from the OSINT framework to build a strong profile of the company consisting of usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.

<b>Phase 2</b>: Perform enumeration and host discovery to be able to establish an active connection to the target host which will allow the discovery of potential attack vectors in the system.

<b>Phase 3</b>: Perform vulnerability scanning and identification.

<b>Phase 4</b>: Perform a threat assessment identifying known vulnerabilities, potential risks, remediation actions, and CVSS scores.

<b>Phase 5</b>: Write up the detailed technical report and executive summary.
